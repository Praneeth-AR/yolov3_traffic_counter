## Introduction
A vehicle counter with keras-YOLOv3 from https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3.git and SORT algorithm for tracking

I used my own dataset here, I trained about 2300 images. So I guess you can train your model with more images

## Quick Start
1. You can use weight from YOLO website (http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) or use your own trained weight
2. Change lines coordinate with your own video in main.py
3. Set path file with your own path
3. run main.py 

## A Demo of Traffic Counting: traffic camera surveillance is used for detecting vehicles
